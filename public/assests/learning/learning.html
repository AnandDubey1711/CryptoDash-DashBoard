            <h1>What is CryptoCurrency ?</h1>
            <p>Cryptocurrency is a digital payment system that doesn't rely on banks to verify transactions. It's a
                peer-to-peer system that can enable anyone anywhere to send and receive payments. Instead of being
                physical money carried around and exchanged in the real world, cryptocurrency payments exist purely as
                digital entries to an online database describing specific transactions. When you transfer cryptocurrency
                funds, the transactions are recorded in a public ledger. Cryptocurrency is stored in digital wallets.
            </p>
            <p>
                Cryptocurrency received its name because it uses encryption to verify transactions. This means advanced
                coding is involved in storing and transmitting cryptocurrency data between wallets and to public
                ledgers. The aim of encryption is to provide security and safety.</p>
            <p>
                The first cryptocurrency was Bitcoin, which was founded in 2009 and remains the best known today. Much
                of the interest in cryptocurrencies is to trade for profit, with speculators at times driving prices
                skyward.

            <h2>How it works ?</h2>
            <p>Cryptocurrencies run on a distributed public ledger called blockchain, a record of all transactions
                updated and held by currency holders. </p>

            <p>
                Units of cryptocurrency are created through a process called mining, which involves using computer power
                to solve complicated mathematical problems that generate coins. Users can also buy the currencies from
                brokers, then store and spend them using cryptographic wallets. </p>
            <p>
                If you own cryptocurrency, you don't own anything tangible. What you own is a key that allows you to
                move a record or a unit of measure from one person to another without a trusted third party. </p>
            <p>
                Although Bitcoin has been around since 2009, cryptocurrencies and applications of blockchain technology
                are still emerging in financial terms, and more uses are expected in the future. Transactions including
                bonds, stocks, and other financial assets could eventually be traded using the technology.

            <h2>Blockchain</h2>
            <p>
                Blockchain is a shared, immutable ledger that facilitates the process of recording transactions and
                tracking assets in a business network. An asset can be tangible (a house, car, cash, land) or intangible
                (intellectual property, patents, copyrights, branding).

            <p>Unless you already own cryptocurrency, you'll need to make an account with a crypto brokerage. Coinbase, Crypto.com and eToro are among the best crypto brokerages on the market. All 3 of these options offer a simple user interface and a variety of altcoins to choose from.</p>
            <p>
                To make an account, you'll need to provide your crypto brokerage with personal identification information, similar to opening an account with a stock brokerage. Some common information you need to provide when setting up your account includes your Social Security number, address, date of birth and email address.</p>
            <p>
                Cryptocurrencies  are  witnessing  a  growing  interest  from  investors  and  media.  They  are increasingly  perceived  as  a  new  class  of  assets  through  added  benefits,  like  hedging capabilities  and  diversification.  However,  this  does  not  preclude  from  the  fact  that cryptocurrencies can be risky assets. Within such a context, diverse studies were carried out at various risk levels. Our chapter bridges this gap and tries to reconcile varying positions on risk across cryptocurrencies. Particularly, we provide a detailed overview on the main risks to be considered by crypto-traders, namely, technology, fraud, legal, market, liquidity, and COVID-19 pandemic risks. The main findings show that the occurrence of any technological failure tends to rise  insecurity and  distrust  in  the cryptocurrency  technology. This  fact  can be  even further spoiled through frauds' schemes and fake trading volumes. Additionally, the legal framework of the cryptocurrencies is still inconclusive. In terms of market risk, these crypto-assets are riskier than fiat currencies and there is a significant risk contagion across large-cap cryptocurrencies. Then,  a significant  relationship exists  between liquidity  and efficiency  in  the cryptocurrency market, since  price dynamics can  influence the  market liquidity.  Finally, it sorts  out that  the COVID-19  pandemic  heavily  affected  the  cryptocurrency  markets.  Our  chapter  underlines current challenges for investors, regulators, and policymakers.
